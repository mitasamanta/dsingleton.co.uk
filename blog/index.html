It&#8217;s been quite popular, mostly with music blogs. It was built by <a href="http://1bit.markwheeler.net/docs.php"> and myself a year or two ago. </a></p>

                    Going public (again)
                </a>
            </h2>

            <div class="entry-content">
                <p>I started using Twitter a couple of years ago, following the buzz of SXSW &#8216;07. I started out, as almost everyone did, with my statuses open to everyone. There seemed no reason to be private with my status updates. Twitter was a (relatively) new and tiny service, known only to power-geek types so privacy concerns didn&#8217;t really enter in to it.</p>
<p>As I used Twitter more, and Twitter itself became more popular, my updates became more candid - in both opinion and personal information. That&#8217;s a good thing, Twitter thrives on open and honest messages. However, around the same time I got a lot more concerned about privacy. There was a variety of reasons behind this, but a big factor was dealing with a handful of&#8230; unhappy and not very nice users. Suffice to say the internet is a very serious business to some people, and this shifted my mindset from the hypothetical to a more literal.</p>
<p>I switched my updates to private and was pretty happy with this for some time. But over time the decision irked me, I still feel private updates go against the &#8220;spirit&#8221; of Twitter. It also caused some technical annoyances, simple things like using search.twitter.com is broken if you&#8217;re searching your own private updates. It makes API/feed access all the more difficult too.</p>
<p>Tonight I switched my status updates back to public. I&#8217;m not sure if it&#8217;ll stay like that permanently, but we&#8217;ll see. While thinking about that decision I thought about my reasons for going private in the first place;</p>
<ol><li>Opinions - I tend to be pretty forthright about things I don&#8217;t like. With the internet every becoming a permanent archive of everything how would future employers feel about crass heat-of-the-moment comments? The solution here? A little restraint on my part, which all things considered is probably a good thing anyway.</li>
<li>Personal Information - &#8220;I&#8217;m in place X, doing thing Y!&#8221;. This one&#8217;s trickier, after all, one of the best things about Twitter is someone else responding &#8220;Me too&#8221;. But they shouldn&#8217;t have to be following me for that to work. Two solutions here, share less -or- stop caring. I think i&#8217;ve ended up somewhere in the middle. </li>
</ol><p>So that about brings things full circle. In an ideal world there&#8217;s a halfway solution between walled-garden privacy and 100% publicness, but for now the technology just isn&#8217;t there and i&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s exactly what people want.</p>

So yes, this will be a fairly quickly written up little rant, please treat it as such.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before the only negative I came away from the conference with was the Hot topics panel. This was mainly for two reasons, with only vague relation to each other.</p>
<h3>Gender and Variety</h3>
<p>The discussion of sexism and the under-representation of women in our industry has been going on for some time, more vocally recently. Until now it’s something I’ve avoided posting about. It’s a tricky situation, but still something that has been blown out of all proportion.</p>
<p>Alas the more we talk about it, arguing back and forth, the gender of a speaker becomes more and more important. Thusly i’ve kept my distance and not agitate the proverbial hive of bees.</p>

<p>I’ve been using them a little recently for a few things, including this blog and some <a href="http://http/code/">coding</a> projects. The problem is, with 1000 icons, finding the ones that are suitable for what you’re doing.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/">Silk webpage</a> used to have every icon on the page, with a little search box to only show ones matching your search. This was great, you could filter down to the more relevant ones, while still comparing them on the same page.</p>

            <div class="entry-content">
                <p>I’ve been back a couple of days now, so of course people have asked how it was, and my response has been ‘<em>Amazing</em>‘. I really do mean that, the entire week was great. It was a fantastic holiday, full of interesting panels, great people, delicious food and excellent parties. I’ve already started hustling friends into coming next year.</p>
<p>My original plan was to make a blog post once a day, which fell by the way side pretty quickly, after two days infact. It turns out SXSW is really quite a lot of <em>fun</em>, and theres not the time for blogging or uploading photos to <a title="My SXSW photos" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/tags/sxsw/">flickr</a>. I didn’t take long to realise SXSW is as much about parties as it is panels.</p>
<p>In my book this is a good thing, a great thing. A lot of the ideas being discussd in panels aren’t new to me, topics I already know well or could learn somewhere else. There are a lots of great UK conferences, there are community events, there are lots of blog posts, articles and tutorials online that can help with this. So I made a point of going to the more obscure panels I knew little about and the social side of things.</p>
<p>I’m a little glad that the trip was mostly self funded, i’d feel kind of bad if work had funded the whole thing as I missed quite a few panels due to hangovers. It’s not that i’ve come away without learning anything, just that a lot of what I learnt wasn’t directly related to my day-to-day job.</p>
<p>A very brief round up of what I enjoyed would include; <strong>Panels:</strong> <a title="Everything's Gone Douglas Coupland" href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060283">Douglas Coupland</a>, <a title="ARG!

                <h1>SXSW Day Two</h1>
<p>So i’ve already fallen a day behind on my plan to throw something up here every day.</p>
<p>I just got in on friday, so my recolection of yesterday is a little hazy.</p>
<p>It turns out we get free breakfast, score! Decided to avoid the geekery and conference stuff a bit and walked down to part of South Congress that a stewardess on our Austin flight recomended to me. Lots of little boutiques, indie stores and thift stores. Pretty cool and very cheap, bought a pretty nifty shirt.</p>
<p>Had some fantastic mexican food at the Rio Grande just round the corner from our hotel, really nice, and so far the only food i’ve not taken food porn pictures of. I’ve been told theres even better mexican resteraunts around so i’ll have to check some of those out over the next few days.</p>
<p>Since the weathers been great Frances and I decided to chill out by the pool and maybe go for a swim. The later part of this plan got abandonded pretty quickly as the pool was colder than the english channel. Unfortunately chilling round the pool in austin sunlight, without sunblock, when you’re pale and british means instant burning. So i’m going to have a pink complection.</p>
<p>In addition to free breakfast, turns out we also get happy hour, 60 minutes of free wine/beer (Delete as applicable). Life is good.</p>
<p>A group of us went out to a Cuban place near 6th, Mojitos all round and some pretty nice food (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/">Photos on flickr</a>). Followed by a lot of drinking, socialising and table football at Buffalo Billiards. Needless to say as a brit with little expirence of foosball, I got my ass wooped. Lucky Stuart and Paul stepped up and recovered our nations pride.</p>

                <p>Finally arrived in Austin, unpacked, had a shower and feel human again.</p>
<p>Frances and I left hammersmith at the <em>ungodly </em>hour of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/414170910/">5am</a>, this is not a real time, it deosn’t exist for normal people.</p>
<p>Met up with Ben, Fatty and Steve at gatwick for breakfast and got ourselves organised for the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/414170569/">10 hour flight</a> to Houston.</p>
<p>We got stuck there for a few hours <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/414170444/">due to a delay</a>, but eventually got to austin and to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/414170331/">Hotel</a>.</p>

<p>Although it’s handy to host this at work I think it’d be for the best to get some proper hosting. We’ve done quite a lot of internal network reorganising recently, which means availability has been a bit patchy. I’ve been looking at switching to <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a>, as they have a pretty nice set of features, but I’m curious if anyone would recomend anything else?</p>

<p>Tomorrow (Thursday) marks <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/149547/">Pub Standards XV</a>, the usual web/booze collision in the middle of London. The sly of you may noticed that the landmark <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/148676/">Pub Standards C</a> has been scheduled for March 13, 2014, I think Patrick might be being a <em>little</em> optomistic.</p>

<p>Challenges are always open, and your entries are automatically scored so you can start playing right away!</p></blockquote>
<p>I spent most of the holidays tweeking and tuning my enrty for the <a title="Code Golf - 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall" href="http://codegolf.com/99-bottles-of-beer">99 bottles</a> and managed to get my entry down to <strong>209&#160;</strong>bytes. Far from a winning score, but for my first attempt - and using PHP - i’m quite pleased.</p>

You can search by a variety of languages, licence types and best of all by regular expressions.</p>
<p>There’s already been a lot of interesting, funny, and downright scary things turned up, best summed up By <a title="Google code search @ Kottke.org" href="http://www.kottke.org/06/10/google-code-search">Jason Kottke</a>. Some of the highlights include<a href="http://google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=fuck&amp;btnG=Search"> profanity</a>, <a href="http://google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22+why+god+why%22&amp;btnG=Search">frustration</a> and and of course <a href="http://google.com/codesearch?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=%22i+have+no+idea%22&amp;btnG=Search">losing all hope</a>.</p>

                <p>I came across a rather impressive list of ‘<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~hottub/software/programming_quotes.html">Programming Quotes</a>‘ today, some humurous, some insightful, some neither, some both.</p>
<p>Definately worth a quickskim through, my favourites:</p>
<blockquote><p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>Brian W. Kernighan</cite></p>
<blockquote><p>The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time.   The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>Tom Cargill</cite></p>
<blockquote><p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think “I know, I’ll use  regular expressions.” Now they have two problems.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>Jamie Zawinski</cite></p>
<blockquote><p>Good code is its own best documentation. As you’re about to add a comment, ask yourself, ‘How can I improve the code so that this comment isn’t needed?’ Improve the code and then document it to make it even clearer.</p></blockquote>
<p><cite>Steve McConnell</cite>
