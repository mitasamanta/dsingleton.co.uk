  <p>I’ve been back a couple of days now, so of course people have asked how it was, and my response has been ‘<em>Amazing</em>‘. I really do mean that, the entire week was great. It was a fantastic holiday, full of interesting panels, great people, delicious food and excellent parties. I’ve already started hustling friends into coming next year.</p>
<p>My original plan was to make a blog post once a day, which fell by the way side pretty quickly, after two days infact. It turns out SXSW is really quite a lot of <em>fun</em>, and theres not the time for blogging or uploading photos to <a title="My SXSW photos" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/tags/sxsw/">flickr</a>. I didn’t take long to realise SXSW is as much about parties as it is panels.</p>
<p>In my book this is a good thing, a great thing. A lot of the ideas being discussd in panels aren’t new to me, topics I already know well or could learn somewhere else. There are a lots of great UK conferences, there are community events, there are lots of blog posts, articles and tutorials online that can help with this. So I made a point of going to the more obscure panels I knew little about and the social side of things.</p>
<p>I’m a little glad that the trip was mostly self funded, i’d feel kind of bad if work had funded the whole thing as I missed quite a few panels due to hangovers. It’s not that i’ve come away without learning anything, just that a lot of what I learnt wasn’t directly related to my day-to-day job.</p>
<p>A very brief round up of what I enjoyed would include; <strong>Panels:</strong> <a title="Everything's Gone Douglas Coupland" href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060283">Douglas Coupland</a>, <a title="ARG!

Should Publishers Choose the Porn Path?" href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060205">Learning from Adult Sites</a>, <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060257">Warren Spector on Storytelling</a> and <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060111">Will Wright’s Keynote</a>. <strong>Parties</strong>: <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/144002/">Great British Booze-Up</a>, <a href="http://www.purevolume.com/promotions/tejas2007/">Pure Volume</a>, <a href="http://upcoming.org/event/152140/">Frog Design</a>.</p>
