  <p>Last week I had the pleasure of speaking at the <a href="http://dibiconference.com">Design It, Build It</a> conference in Newcastle, where I gave a talk entitled “<strong>Last.fm vs Xbox</strong>.”</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/davidsingleton/4581329945/" title="Last.fm vs Xbox by David Singleton, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4025/4581329945_80569310dd.jpg" width="500" height="365" alt="Last.fm vs Xbox"/></a></p>

<p>It was a 30 minute presentation of our experience at <a href="http://last.fm/">Last.fm</a> launching a radio application to millions of <a href="http://live.xbox.com">Xbox Live</a> users. It was a mix of the Last.fm vs Xbox  story, how we dealt with it, the tools we used and general tips for anyone dealing with large scale launches. I think it went pretty well, people seemed to enjoy it, even a few designers!</p>

<p>The presentation is <a href="http://slideshare.net/davidsingleton/lastfm-vs-xbox">available on Slideshare</a>. I kept the slides “word heavy” so they&#8217;d make sense without the accompanying talk, though if you have any questions please do get in touch and i&#8217;ll try and help.</p>

<p>I promised some people I that I&#8217;d write more about how to find out about and get started with some of the technology and tools mentioned. I&#8217;m still catching up on life and work in London after an extended stay in Newcastle but i&#8217;ll be posting that soon — and going in to a bit more detail about the slides themselves.</p>

<h3>Build It</h3>
<p>The rest of the build line-up was excellent. <a href="http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk">Michael Brunton-Spall</a> gave an overview of <a href="http://mps-guardian.co.uk/">The Guardian&#8217;s</a> scaling challenges and how they approach rapid application building, such as the <a href="http://mps-expenses.guardian.co.uk/">MPs expenses</a> crowd-sourcing effort</p>

<p>I <a href="http://morethanseven.net/">Gareth Rushgrove&#8217;s</a> “You&#8217;re going to need a bigger toolbox” a perfect topic for a conference to tackle. There are hundreds of languages &amp; tools available but Gareth gave a great overview of some interesting ones you should learn more about on your own, getting you rather excited in the process. There&#8217;s a collection of all the <a href="http://delicious.com/coldclimate/dibi">built-it presentation slides</a> which are well worth reading.</p>

<h3>Design It</h3>
<p>Sadly I missed the Design-It talks, but heard good things. I&#8217;m particularly looking forward to seeing slides and videos for <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/">Andy Clarke</a> &amp; <a href="http://colly.com/">Simon Collision</a>, but i&#8217;ll be watching all of them when I have the chance.</p>

<h3>Thanks</h3>
<p>I have to say a massive thanks to the organisers (particularly <a href="http://twitter.com/gavinelliot">@gavinelliott</a> &amp; <a href="http://twitter.com/coldclimate">@coldclimate</a>) for running a brilliant event. I know first hand that even running a small tech event is a royal pain but they made it look easy.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve booked my <a href="http://www.amiando.com/dibi2011.html">ticket for next year</a> already and am looking forward to enjoying the day as a relaxed attendee. See you there?</p>
